Version 0.95 (February 2024)
-Fixed a bug where LASSO progress would extend past the number of data sets if any number of data sets were deleted

-Fixed a bug where after unmixing visual previews of data sets from the Home tab used ExampleArray rather than the appropriate row of ProcessedArray

-Fixed a bug where modifying a reference would not update composite colors

-Composite images for merged components no longer use alpha blending and instead create RGB-balanced uint8 images

-Composite images will automatically adjusted contrast/brightness values in previews to create more accurate color balancing before user manually sets values and will utilize component image values for generation to improve visual consistency

-Added a check for the required MATLAB version and all appropriate toolboxes

-Added a text field to the Gaussian Blur UI for manually entering threshold

-Gaussian Blur default starting value is now set at the first <20 bin after the maximum bin

-ToggleEnable() has been changed to ToggleChildrenEnable() which changes the enable status of an UI elements matching a preset list, allowing for more comprehensive function

-The Final Adjustments and Export panels have been combined into a one, with two buttons: “Quantification Calculations” and “Contrast/Brightness & Final Export”

-Contrast/Brightness & Final Export UIs have been created that replaces the simplified export logic; manages contrast and brightness ranges for all image types simultaneously and allows for additional z-projections and key frames on top of raw and processed averages and stacks, unmixed reference images, and composite unmixed images before export table

-Export now includes a .mat file with all the arrays used so process integrity can be verified by the user and generated data can be further processed if necessary

-Future feature launch buttons for save state datasets, auto-calibrating LASSO lambdas, and quantification have been enabled by default to ensure better compatibility with ToggleChildrenEnable(), now showing a WIP message as a placeholder

-NormalizeMinMax has been replaced by a standard MATLAB function to improve efficiency

-Extended reference file loading progress until the reshaping UI is finished

-Created a function for uislider compartments to overcome issues with limited positional control

-Adjusted the FitPanel arrangement for design consistency

-Created a prompt that warns the user of deleting references after LASSO unmixing has occurred of necessary manual recalculation and unmixing weights holding in current calculations

-Added a check for parallel pools even if loading is below the threshold to use existing pools if valid

-UIs now disable before checks to ensure users don't interact with components while checks are processing (mostly affected older systems)

-Added catches for any external window processes and allows to code to proceed without triggering errors or crashes when import attempts fail, overwriting the previous system of continuous prompts with a while loop
