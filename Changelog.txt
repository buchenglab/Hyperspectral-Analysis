Version 1.20 (April 2024)
-Fixed a bug where spectra would not correctly export and only appeared as white rectangles on certain operating systems
-Added a reverse option to stacked and overlayed spectra for more presentation-friendly figures
-Rebuilt FormatUI to support differentiating pure images and existing spectra
-Added support for spectral imports for existing spectra as single column *.txt files and variables from *.mat
-Built a *.mat parser interface to find vector spectra or select multiple spectra from a matrix
-Added spectral management for existing reference spectra in ChemicalRefParameters, with an option to extend new functions into BrowserPanel
-Fixed an issue where some background removal ranges would have non-normalized values
-Uploaded a workflow diagram for new users

Version 1.15 (April 2024)
-Added customization for spectral fitting calibration
-Changed operating order of some spectral graphing to run faster

Version 1.1 (April 2024)
-Added faster processing for BM4D datasets
-Added median filtering as another background removal tool
-Fixed a bug where loading bars would not properly handle variable exports, now indeterminate to simplify procedures
-Fixed a visual glitch that can occur when using uigetdir() in MATLAB
-Adjustments to GitHub repository to better integrate with MATLAB File Exchange

Version 1.0 (April 2024)
-Built in BM4D support for all standard profiles, linking the Tampere University distribution
-Created customed handling of BM4D to better integrate with core code
-Fixed a bug where initialization would detect variables even if the workspace was clean before prompting warnings
-Simplified binary subtraction to improve performance
-Renamed software to DECPIHER

Version 0.98 (April 2024)
-Repackaged as a MATLAB toolbox for better release and feature management
-Added a try/catch to peak detection selection when using chemical references for cases when users quit
-Added ResolutionScaler for use in FontSize statements to adjustment for additional display resolutions more cleanly
-Added a new xlim statement for GraphSpectra to create appropriate x-axis padding for spectra plotted
-Updated certain font sizes to scale more cleanly with ResolutionScaler and minimize incompatibility on 3K and 4K displays
-Adjusted the capture statements for continued figure use after export such that home tab and adjustments both remain operational and can proceed to additional processing/exports while additional adjust tabs will be caught and disabled to prevent confusion
-Added a stop unmixing checkbox to LASSO to prevent unnecessary previews and adjusted logic around UpdateAdvancedParam to accomodate
-Graphing key frames xlines now provides a label in case WaveCalibrate organization limits display of frame correctly against plot
-Changed the export message to accurately reflect the current image set and data file of focus being exported with an update value progress bar
-Removed remnant code for PreviewExport as more precise and less intensive preview is available in the AdjustTab, making it redundant
-Added non-contrast/brightness adjusted versions to export (composite images now save as a non-CB version, a version that uses the components with adjusted CB but not CB-adjusted itself, and a full CB version using adjusted CB from the components)
-Added export of spectra used if calibration exists with saved states of individual spectra, overlayed spectra, and stacked spectra
-Added support for color re-roll on creating new references to avoid heavy overlaps
-Changed overwrite for repeated unmixing to ensure only latest results are used, and set confirmation pop-up for deleting references after conducting unmixing
-LaunchRemoval changed to LaunchSubtract to avoid conflict with future function call for upcoming features
-Updated how Path works to accommodate selecting the folder repeatedly when importing data and references
-Added a directory prompt when exporting to set correct directory relative to the current operating path from imports
-Changed exporting dialogues and titling to better read which file and dataset is currently under export
-Check for workspace variables and existing figures before launch to ensure minimal MATLAB workspace

Version 0.95 (February 2024)
-Fixed a bug where LASSO progress would extend past the number of data sets if any number of data sets were deleted
-Fixed a bug where after unmixing visual previews of data sets from the Home tab used ExampleArray rather than the appropriate row of ProcessedArray
-Fixed a bug where modifying a reference would not update composite colors
-Composite images for merged components no longer use alpha blending and instead create RGB-balanced uint8 images
-Composite images will automatically adjusted contrast/brightness values in previews to create more accurate color balancing before user manually sets values and will utilize component image values for generation to improve visual consistency
-Added a check for the required MATLAB version and all appropriate toolboxes
-Added a text field to the Gaussian Blur UI for manually entering threshold
-Gaussian Blur default starting value is now set at the first <20 bin after the maximum bin
-ToggleEnable() has been changed to ToggleChildrenEnable() which changes the enable status of an UI elements matching a preset list, allowing for more comprehensive function
-The Final Adjustments and Export panels have been combined into a one, with two buttons: “Quantification Calculations” and “Contrast/Brightness & Final Export”
-Contrast/Brightness & Final Export UIs have been created that replaces the simplified export logic; manages contrast and brightness ranges for all image types simultaneously and allows for additional z-projections and key frames on top of raw and processed averages and stacks, unmixed reference images, and composite unmixed images before export table
-Export now includes a .mat file with all the arrays used so process integrity can be verified by the user and generated data can be further processed if necessary
-Future feature launch buttons for save state datasets, auto-calibrating LASSO lambdas, and quantification have been enabled by default to ensure better compatibility with ToggleChildrenEnable(), now showing a WIP message as a placeholder
-NormalizeMinMax has been replaced by a standard MATLAB function to improve efficiency
-Extended reference file loading progress until the reshaping UI is finished
-Created a function for uislider compartments to overcome issues with limited positional control
-Adjusted the FitPanel arrangement for design consistency
-Created a prompt that warns the user of deleting references after LASSO unmixing has occurred of necessary manual recalculation and unmixing weights holding in current calculations
-Added a check for parallel pools even if loading is below the threshold to use existing pools if valid
-UIs now disable before checks to ensure users don't interact with components while checks are processing (mostly affected older systems)
-Added catches for any external window processes and allows to code to proceed without triggering errors or crashes when import attempts fail, overwriting the previous system of continuous prompts with a while loop

Version 0.9 (December 2023)
